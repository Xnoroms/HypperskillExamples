In this problem, you are Sherlock Holmes and you want to quickly detect all anagrams.

Write a program that finds out whether two words are anagrams or not. If one word is an anagram of another, print "yes", else print "no".

Note: anagrams are words that contain the same characters with the same frequencies. In other words, anagrams are created by changing the order of letters in the word.

For example:

"ppaaagg" (p - 2; a - 3; g - 2) and "gagaapp" (p - 2; a - 3; g - 2) are anagrams;
"hello" (h - 1; e - 1; l - 2; o - 1) and "helllo" (h - 1; e - 1; l - 3; o - 1) are not anagrams.
Remember: anagrams are case-insensitive.

Sample Input 1:

ppaaagg
gagaapp
Sample Output 1:

yes
